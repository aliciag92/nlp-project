    "# Project Description and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses programming & machine learning techniques to help understand and make use of large amounts of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files in order to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives for this project include:\n",
    "- Building a dataset based on a list of GitHub repositories to scrape, and writing the python code necessary to extract the text of the README file for each page, and the primary language of the repository.\n",
    "- Documenting process and analysis throughout the data science pipeline.\n",
    "- Constructing a classification model that can predict what programming language a repository is in, given the text of the README file.\n",
    "- Deliverables:\n",
    "    - A well-documented jupyter notebook that contains my analysis.\n",
    "    - One or two content slides suitable for a general audience that summarize findings with a well-labeled visualization included in slides.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Pipeline Process:\n",
    "1. Acquire\n",
    "2. Prepare\n",
    "3. Explore\n",
    "4. Model/Evaluate\n",
    "5. Deliver\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial hypotheses\n",
    "- What are the most frequently occuring words in READMEs?\n",
    "- Are there any words that uniquely identify a programming language?\n",
    "- What are the top word combinations (bigrams and trigrams)?"
